feat_dualcode
=======

This code is inspired by the paper of E.A. Allen, E.B. Erhardt, and V.D. Calhoun (Neuron 20012). 

They suggest a simple, yet thourough representation scheme for statistical maps obtained with fMRI GLM analyses.Their idea behind this is to "Show more, hide less!". 

This neat plotting scheme was implemented here as matlab function that can cope with 3D nifti files. In addition to this, a wrapper BASH script is provided that allows to easily create dual coded images from an existing feat directory.

Please cite the original paper of Allen, Erhardt, and Calhoun when using the scripts provided here:
